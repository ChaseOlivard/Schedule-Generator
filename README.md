# Schedule-Generator
Schedule Generator project for CSC 3380 (Object Oriented Programming). 
This is a basic java schedule generator that takes user input and displays the users schedule in a java swing GUI along with recommending activities for the user to do during their free time. There were additional features that we wanted to implement but under a short time constraint many of those features were left out.
